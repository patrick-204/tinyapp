## File Explanation

express_server.js
- This file is the main server file for the TinyApp project. It sets up the Express server, defines routes, handles user authentication and manages URL shortening functionality. The following is a breakdown of the file:

- Dependencies: Imports required libraries and helper functions.
- Server Setup: Initializes an Express app, sets up middleware for parsing requests, and configures sessions using cookie-session.
- Routes:
    - GET /login: Renders the login page or redirects to the /urls page if the user is already logged in.
    - POST /login: Handles user login authentication and sets user session.
    - GET /register: Renders the register page or redirects to the /urls page if the user is already logged in.
    - POST /register: Handles user registration and redirects to the login page.
    - GET /urls: Renders the URLs page with a list of shortened URLs for the logged-in user.
    - GET /urls/new: Renders the page for creating a new shortened URL.
    - GET /urls/:id: Renders the page to view a specific shortened URL's details.
    - GET /u/:id: Redirects short URLs to their original long URLs.
    - POST /urls: Handles the creation of a new shortened URL.
    - POST /urls/:id/delete: Handles deletion of a shortened URL.
    - POST /urls/:id: Handles updating the long URL of a shortened URL.
    - POST /logout: Logs out the user by clearing the session and redirects to the login page.
    - Server Initialization: Sets the server to listen on a specified port.
